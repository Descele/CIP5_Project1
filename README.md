# CIP5_Project1
Data Analysis Project: Household Occupancy Buffalo,NY,USA

"Stanford University’s Code in Place—a global initiative inspired by CS 106A—equipped me with rigorous Python foundations through project-based learning. These projects reflect how I bridge code and urban analysis, transforming abstract concepts into tools for spatial problem-solving.

As an urban planner, I designed solutions that demonstrate Python’s versatility: automating workflows, analyzing datasets, and visualizing urban patterns. Each project here began as a technical exercise but evolved into a lens for interdisciplinary thinking—proof that programming isn’t just for engineers, but for anyone shaping cities.

This data analysis tool—my first Code in Place project—demonstrates how Python can transform raw housing statistics into actionable urban insights. Using American Community Survey data (S2501 Occupancy Characteristics), I built an interactive explorer for the Buffalo-Cheektowaga metro area that reveals hidden patterns in housing occupancy, ownership, and neighborhood change.

Key Features:
✔ Real-world dataset processing – Parses CSV files with error handling
✔ Interactive CLI menu – Navigate occupancy rates, household sizes, and housing types
✔ Margin-of-error analysis – Displays statistical confidence intervals
✔ Modular design – Separates data loading, display logic, and user interaction

Technical Highlights:
Clean data ingestion with csv module and dictionary comprehensions
Hierarchical category/subcategory exploration
Robust input validation for error-free use

### **File breakdown**  
Here's a short explanation of each file in this project:  

- **README.md** [you are here!] : Project documentation   
- **Housing_data.txt** : Raw data file related to housing metrics (e.g., occupancy rates, demographics)  
- **main.py** : Main Python script for data processing or simulation  
- **requirements.txt** : Lists PyPi packages required to run the project  
- **LICENSE** : Standard software license terms 
- **gitignore.txt** : Specifies files/folders Git should ignore (e.g., temporary files, local configs)
